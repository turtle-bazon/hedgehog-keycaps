# Printing guide

You can print as you think it will be better, but I personally prefer print it at 45 degree and 0.1 mm layer height. Also 75 degrees give good results. Placing bottom side to table allow you to acheive good surface, placing up uside to table could eliminate usage of supports.

## Bottom side to table 45 degree
